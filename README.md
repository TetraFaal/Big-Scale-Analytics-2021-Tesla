## The Idea (project description) üìú
To improve one‚Äôs skills in a new foreign language, it is important to read texts in that language. These text have to be at the reader‚Äôs language level. However, it is difficult to find texts that are close to someone‚Äôs knowledge level (A1 to C2). The idea is to build a model for English speakers that predicts the difficulty of a French written text. This can be then used, e.g., in a recommendation system, to recommend texts (for example, recent news articles) that are appropriate for someone‚Äôs language level. If someone is at A1 French level, it is inappropriate to present a text at B2 level, as she won‚Äôt be able to understand it. Ideally, a text should have many known words and may have a few words that are unknown so that the person can improve.

In order to learn more about the subject, we consulted various research sources including the same objectives such as :

## Milestones & Goals üéØ
The project is separated in three main milestones :
1. Thinking how to model the problem and gathering data (French texts, sentences, news articles etc.) and labelling them with the relevant level
2. Building a model that predicts the difficulty/level of a new text
3. Evaluating how good the model is

The final goal is to provide an API with an UI wich returns the level of a given french sentence.

## Data üìä
The data used for this project comes from two different sources. The first data set was created by our team based on relevant literary sources. The second, larger than the first, was imposed on us by our teachers. Each dataset contains two columns, the first one contains the sentences to be analysed and the second one represents the label of each sentence (A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2).

Exemple :

| Sentences | Label |
| :---         |          ---: |
| Bonjour, je m'appelle Lucia. | A1 |

### First data set

In order to create our dataset, we had to find specific ressources that are a reference in the labeling of french language. We have used several sources such as grammar exercises, french language learning websites and sources provided by teachers. After collecting **1224 sentences**, we objectively assessed their levels under different selection criteria like words, verbs, cognats, grammar and expressions difficulties.

#### Number of sentences per level :
- A1 : 221
- A2 : 209
- B1 : 192
- B2 : 203
- C1 : 197
- C2 : 202

### Second data set
This dataset was downloaded from the AIcrowd project associated with our course. It is divided into two parts, train data with **4800 sentences** and test data with **1200 sentences**. The train data will allow us to train the prediction models, so it is important to have a good distribution of labels (target).

#### Labels of the train data :
- A1 : 800
- A2 : 800
- B1 : 800
- B2 : 800
- C1 : 800
- C2 : 800

## Tools üõ†
Different tools are used for this project :
- Google Colab Python Notebooks
- Google Cloud Services
- Jupyter Python Notebook
- App Engine
- Natural Language
- Flask
- Pickle

## Preprocessing
We will use the second train data set to train the prediction models described in the previous chapter. We will focus on the preprocessing of this data set by combining the following methods:
- Punctuation: we removed all '!"#$%&()*+,./:;<=>?@\[]_{|}~'] characters from sentences.
- Digit : we have removed all digits (1-9) from sentences.
You can find the python files [here](https://github.com/TetraFaal/Big-Scale-Analytics-2021-Tesla/tree/main/Code/Python%20Colab%20for%20AutoML).

## Tokenizer
In order to tokenise the words in each sentence of our data set, we used the appropriate spacy library for the French language ('fr_core_news_sm'). This will allow our models to better identify the links between words and labels. 

## Google Cloud AutoML
### First Iteration

As a first try using the google cloud autoML, we labbeled the sentences according to their respective level in french. The tool proposed by google calculated automatically using a classification method. 

With a threshold set at 0.5, we have the following results:

- The precision is of 62.71%
- The recall is of 38.54%

#### Per class score

| Label | Precision | Recall |
| :---         |     :---:      |          ---: |
| A1   | 76.06%     | 67.5%    |
| A2     | 61.36%       | 33.75%      |
| B1   | 51.61%     | 20%    |
| B2     | 59.09%       | 32.5%      |
| C1  | 52.63%     | 25%    |
| C2    | 62.69%       | 52.5%      |

#### Confusion matrix

- The accuracy is of 51.88%

### Second iteration

As the first results were not satisfying, we decided to include the cognats in our second iteration.
We've worked on Google Colab to pre-process our data (punctuation), tokenize the sentences, and put the number and whihch cognates each sentence has as a feature.

With a threshold set at 0.5, we have the following results:

- The precision is of 65.69%
- The recall is of 27.92%

#### Per class score

| Label | Precision | Recall |
| :---         |     :---:      |          ---: |
| A1   | 76.06%     | 67.5%    |
| A2     | 65.52%       | 23.75%      |
| B1   | 42.31%     | 13.75%    |
| B2     | 66.67%       | 12.5%      |
| C1  | 60%     | 18.75%    |
| C2    | 65.79%       | 31.25%      |

#### Confusion matrix

- The accuracy is of 49.79%

As a conclusion to this iteration, the way we uploaded the cognates into the dataset resulted in Google autoML not capable of recognizing the weight of the cognates.

### Third iteration

We realised that the models created by AutoML (Natural language) did not know how to interpret tokenised sentences and that the cognates were not presented in an optimal way. Therefore, we performed a new iteration with punctuation and digits processing. We also added weight to each cognate by duplicating them in the sentences where they are present. Thanks to this, the labelling of the sentences will allow us to know the value of the cognates. 

For example, if a 10-word sentence has 3 cognates and is labelled as "C2", this will mean that the identified cognates do not allow for a better understanding of the sentence. In another case, if a sentence with words often labelled as "B1" and with cognates has been labelled as "A2", this will confirm that the identified cognates allow a better understanding of the sentence even if the other words are more difficult. 

With a threshold set at 0.6, we have the following results:

- The precision is of 68.18%
- The recall is of 28.13%

#### Per class score

| Label | Precision | Recall |
| :---         |     :---:      |          ---: |
| A1   | 68.33%     | 51.25%    |
| A2     | 65%       | 32.5%      |
| B1   | 61.11%     | 13.75%    |
| B2     | 61.11%       | 13.75%      |
| C1  | 64%     | 20%    |
| C2    | 69.77%       | 37.5%      |

#### Confusion matrix

- The accuracy is of 53.13%

This iteraction is the best of AutoML iterations, we will take it for combining with other models in our API.

## CamemBERT - Jupyter Model

We there tried to use an existing model called CamemBERT and adapt it to our use case. The main advantage and purpose of why we chose to use this model is that it is already trained on the french language. The model was mainly used to predict sentiments on text analysis. 

More information about the model is available [here](https://camembert-model.fr/)

As Google AutoML was limiting the possibility of personnalisation of the model and was not letting us to deal with cognates the desired way, we decided to try a different solution to add some weights to the cognates. First, we tried the same dataset that we had used on Google AutoML to compare the results on AICrowd, without touching the Cognates. It resulted that our Camembert Model was more accurate with an accuracy of 54%.

Then, we tried to remove completely the sentences where there were some cognates. The idea was that an english speaker would understand any given sentence with more ease if a cognates appear, even if the word is labelled as difficult in french. Thus, removing the cognates would not affect the labelisation made by our model only based on the difficulty of a french word that is understandable by a native english speaker. The accuracy of this method was indeed higher with 56.4% and led us to the 4th place in AICrowd.

The last method that was tried is described in the NoteBooks, available from this [link](https://github.com/TetraFaal/Big-Scale-Analytics-2021-Tesla/tree/main/Code/NoteBook)

The reader may want to try his own predictions based on our model, thus we used a package called Pickle to save our pre-trained Model. The link to download it is also located in the NoteBook folder.

## Other Models - Jupyter Model

To diversify and try other methods we have used another notebook containing different models. As those were less accurate than CamemBERT and Google autoML we decided not to upload them directly on this repository and therefore just provide a short summary of the results.

Below is the summary of the tested models and their respective accuracy:

We decided to further train the linear SVC, which resulted in the following confusion matrix:

And finally a classification report:

## Combining Models and structure of our solution
We have chosen to take the best iterations of the AutoML (Natural language) model and the CamemBERT model and combine them directly on the App Engine. Through our Web Page and API, we want the prediction of the label of the submitted sentence to be done in 4 steps:

1) Preprocess the sentence according to the prediction models.
2) Use the two prediction models
3) Average the two results
4) Display the final result on our web page
