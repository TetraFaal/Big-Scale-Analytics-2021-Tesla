# Text Analytics : Prediction Of French Sentences' CEFR Level
Tesla Group's repository for the course project "Big Scale Analytics 2021" (University of Lausanne)

This projects aims to predict the CEFR level of a sentence in a foreign language (here French) based on machine learning techniques.

## The Idea (project description) ðŸ“œ
To improve oneâ€™s skills in a new foreign language, it is important to read texts in that language. These text have to be at the readerâ€™s language level. However, it is difficult to find texts that are close to someoneâ€™s knowledge level (A1 to C2). The idea is to build a model for English speakers that predicts the difficulty of a French written text. This can be then used, e.g., in a recommendation system, to recommend texts (for example, recent news articles) that are appropriate for someoneâ€™s language level. If someone is at A1 French level, it is inappropriate to present a text at B2 level, as she wonâ€™t be able to understand it. Ideally, a text should have many known words and may have a few words that are unknown so that the person can improve.

## Milestones & Goals ðŸŽ¯
The project is separated in three main milestones :
1. Thinking how to model the problem and gathering data (French texts, sentences, news articles etc.) and labelling them with the relevant level
2. Building a model that predicts the difficulty/level of a new text
3. Evaluating how good the model is

The final goal is to provide an API with an UI wich returns the level of a given french sentence.

## Tools ðŸ› 
Different tools are used for this project :
- Google Colab Python Notebooks
- Google Cloud Services

## Repository organisation ðŸ—‚
Here's how the repo is organized :
- Data : you'll find [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oQGKQZLj6JRbgY-ZQLfClUsq-AHA8LIegtSZvxw6s6A/edit#gid=1203710396) all of the 1181 sentences that composes our  data for the project
- Code : the python notebooks containing our code
- Ressources : our [litterature](https://github.com/TetraFaal/Big-Scale-Analytics-2021-Tesla/tree/main/Ressources) review on the subject and usefull ressources

The project is iterative, this repository is meant to evolve regulary
