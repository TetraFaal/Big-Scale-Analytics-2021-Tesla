# Text Analytics : Prediction Of French Sentences' CEFR Level
Tesla Group's repository for the course project "Big Scale Analytics 2021" (University of Lausanne)

This projects aims to predict the CEFR level of a sentence in a foreign language (here French) based on machine learning techniques.

## The Idea (project description) üìú
To improve one‚Äôs skills in a new foreign language, it is important to read texts in that language. These text have to be at the reader‚Äôs language level. However, it is difficult to find texts that are close to someone‚Äôs knowledge level (A1 to C2). The idea is to build a model for English speakers that predicts the difficulty of a French written text. This can be then used, e.g., in a recommendation system, to recommend texts (for example, recent news articles) that are appropriate for someone‚Äôs language level. If someone is at A1 French level, it is inappropriate to present a text at B2 level, as she won‚Äôt be able to understand it. Ideally, a text should have many known words and may have a few words that are unknown so that the person can improve.

In order to learn more about the subject, we consulted various research sources including the same objectives such as :
- Word lists in Reference Level Descriptions of CEFR (Common European Framework of Reference for Languages): https://euralex.org/wp-content/themes/euralex/proceedings/Euralex%202012/pp328-335%20Marello.pdf
- Duolingo's blog on the use of AI for adapting learning content based on CEFR level: https://blog.duolingo.com/the-duolingo-cefr-checker-an-ai-tool-for-adapting-learning-content/

## Milestones & Goals üéØ
The project is separated in three main milestones :
1. Thinking how to model the problem and gathering data (French texts, sentences, news articles etc.) and labelling them with the relevant level
2. Building a model that predicts the difficulty/level of a new text
3. Evaluating how good the model is

The final goal is to provide an API with an UI wich returns the level of a given french sentence.

## Data üìä
In order to create our dataset, we had to find specific ressources that are a reference in the labeling of french language. We have used several sources such as grammar exercises, french language learning websites and sources provided by teachers. After collecting 1180 sentences, we objectively assessed their levels under different selection criteria like words, verbs, cognats, grammar and expressions difficulties. 

### Number of sentences per level :
- A1 : 221
- A2 : 259
- B1 : 189
- B2 : 161
- C1 : 183
- C2 : 160

## Tools üõ†
Different tools are used for this project :
- Google Colab Python Notebooks
- Google Cloud Services

## Repository organisation üóÇ
Here's how the repo is organized :
- Data : you'll find [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oQGKQZLj6JRbgY-ZQLfClUsq-AHA8LIegtSZvxw6s6A/edit#gid=1203710396) all of the 1181 sentences that composes our  data for the project
- Code : the python notebooks containing our code
- Ressources : our [litterature](https://github.com/TetraFaal/Big-Scale-Analytics-2021-Tesla/tree/main/Ressources) review on the subject and usefull ressources

## Methodology :mag:

- Gather existing informations and scientific articles on the subject :white_check_mark:
- Build and labelize a dataset containing french sentences :white_check_mark:
- Look for complete datasets with labelized french words and define the weight of each word
- Deal with cognates
- Build a first algorithm
- Try the algorithm on our dataset
- Train the model
- Adapt/ change the model
- Build a user interface


The project is iterative, this repository is meant to evolve regulary
